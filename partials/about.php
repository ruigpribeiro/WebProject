                        <span class="about-span">Hey there!</span> I'm Rui, a 26-year-old junior software developer.
                        For the past four years, I've worked in hospitality, but my true passion has always been computers. 👨‍💻
                        I've spent countless hours on my computer, whether working, learning new things or just having fun. 🌎
                        Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by computers and even built my first gaming desktop during my teens. 🖥️
                        My programming journey began in 2020 during the covid pandemic when I started learning the basics of programming on my own. 📖  
                        In early 2023, I took a significant step forward and joined a full stack bootcamp, marking the real beginning of my programming career. 👨‍🎓
                        Since then, I've been learning new programming languages and tools, and most recently, I joined a software developer course to further develop my skills. 🤞
